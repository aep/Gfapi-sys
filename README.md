# Gfapi Rust Bindings [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gluster/Gfapi-sys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gluster/Gfapi-sys) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/gfapi-sys/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/gfapi-sys)
The gfapi-sys crate provides declarations and linkage for the 
Gluster gfapi C library.

Higher level safe abstractions are provided by the gluster.rs file.  These safe bindings are only partially implemented.
For an example of how to use the bindings please see the [examples](https://github.com/gluster/Gfapi-sys/tree/master/examples) directory. 

Note: These bindings will fail to build with Glusterfs 3.x series
